How To - Website Documentation
======================================================================

To use the website, simply go to the `home page <https://donate-anything.org>`_
and search up an item that you'd like to donate. You will get organizations
that will accept your donation as search results.

If you'd like, you can press "Add more items" to add another item to your
donation list. A new search button will appear with a magnifying glass.
Once you've completed listing all the items you'd like to donate, you will
be redirected to a new page with organizations that can fulfill the most
items to the least number of items that an organization can fulfill.

That's it! Hint, we'll be adding a leaderboard soon for the most fulfilled
donations. `You can check out our roadmap by clicking here`_.

Process of Adding an Organization
------------------------------------------------

The workflow for authenticating an organization is as follows:

#. Create a personal account, unrelated to your organization.
#. Sign in and press "Apply" at the top navigation bar.
#. Apply for either as an organization/charity (e.g. American Red Cross) or as a business (e.g. recycling center). You can use GitHub flavored `Markdown`_ for rich text editing (like Google Docs or Microsoft Word).
#. Fill out the application and wait for approval by the community and/or admins
#. Once approved, find your organization in the list organizations (you can find this in the community tab)
#. Click into the link. Click on the button for creating new items.
#. A new tab will open. Now you are able to create new items for your organization. **MAKE SURE YOU ADD EVERYTHING you can fulfill. Donate Anything implies practically Anything can be searched up. Make sure you have enough items to be found in any search result made by the user.**

Note: the approval of new items is done through superuser admins, admins
and the community, and/or verified accounts.

Managing Organizations
------------------------------------------------

For the most part, due to the sheer number of organizations in the world, the
community will be maintaining most organizations on the website. This means
the organizations' descriptions, methods of donation, and fulfilled items
will be managed by the community via a republic-style of voting and communication
through our forums and threads.

In the near future, we will be adding a game-like point system, similar to Wikipedia,
for contributing in some form to maintaining the website.

.. _how-to-verified-account:

Verified Accounts
------------------------------------------------

If you are responsible for managing public content of your organization,
then you may want to apply for a verified account.

Verified accounts are able to process items that they'd like rather than what
the community would like to add, giving you more fine grained control over the
description of your organization, methods of donating to your organization, and
acting as an official support role in the community on behalf of your organization.

You should NOT create a new account for this. Admins will create an account
for you. To apply, please fill out `this form`_: https://forms.gle/6zYvcysuNJXqRbGB6

.. _this form: https://forms.gle/6zYvcysuNJXqRbGB6

Once we've processed your application, we will send you your preferred username
and temporary password. You can change and add multiple email accounts and
you can change your password once you login. These are NOT time-sensitive
credentials, but we encourage you to quickly change several parameters.
You will not be able to change your username.

From An Organization?
---------------------

Here are some quick steps that you should do:

#. Create a personal account at: https://donate-anything.org/accounts/signup/
#. Verify your account via email and login.
#. If your organization hasn't been added, go to the `Apply`_ tab and fill out the form.
#. Once your organization shows up in our `community list`_, you can create new items by clicking into your organization and pressing the "To suggest new items, click here"
#. Write as many as you need. There are some generic items that will add hundreds of items at a time like food, female apparel, and others. `You can find the generic items here`_
#. Save it. You can edit it later by following the link the forum.
#. If you'd like a verified account, refer to :ref:`how-to-verified-account`. This will be separate from your personal account, and only one account is created for one organization (for security purposes).
