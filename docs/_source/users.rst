Users
======================================================================

Anyone can be a user to collect points by the number
of donations sent (depending on the items),
maintain organizations that don't have a verified owner
account or are in hybrid mode, gain points for
maintenance and voting in the community, and report content.

Maintaining an organization, if there is no verified
account, is highly likely. Users will be a part of a
community that maintains all aspects of the website.
