Forum
=====

The forum is where the community mostly lives. The following
threads all allow thread chains in Markdown.

- Any time a new application if filled, it will show up in the community as a link type (redirect).
- Suggestions to a charity's description and other info is done through voting in a post. 80% upvote required and staff approval.
- Adding/removing items is done with 6:10 verification votes + 2:1, inclusive, staff vote.

When a new application is filled out, the applicant (who does not need
to be affiliated with the entity) controls what is merged into the
application and what isn't. Suggestions can't be merged like GitHub
commits. Applied entities must be approved by staff to become active
entities to be shown as a result in the search page.

Suggestions for an approved entity/charity still must be approved
by staff before merging with a community 80% majority upvote of 5 or 10 votes
depending on the size of the community. The community can still suggest
edits for verified entities with verified accounts, but the verified
account will be the one merging edits (staff can override).

Adding/removing items are automatically handled by the program (Django signals).
Staff can override the verification votes.

For community posts, you'll need to head to the Reddit community
for posts and Discord for chat.
