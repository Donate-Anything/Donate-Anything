Organizations
=============

Organizations are typically 501(c)3's that can fulfill
donations for a meaningful purpose or cause. Some
organizations that are not 501(c)3's are allowed to be
listed as one - for example, a school or fire department.

All charities will be posted by a user of this website
first. All charities go through a human verification
cycle that checks for a few things:

1. A website to the organization's donation page. If there is no website, the link should show a page of 501(c)3 filing from the `irs.gov <https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/tax-exempt-organization-search>` website.
2. In the description, it is required to fill out where the donations are going and why it is necessary.
3. Finally, fill out how a person can donate.

Typically, humans will verify each one. However, at peak periods,
the user community can collaborate to verify an organization.
This is done through a voting process of 14 days with a 80% upvote
ratio officially allowing the charity to be entered into the database
list. This means the organization will be shown on the website.
Human verifiers can still override any vote.

Managing Organizations
----------------------

If an organization is not managed by an account, then community
members can only follow a specific format:

- Name (unless voted to be locked by the community)
- Link (Optional) to website
- Proof of validity
- Description
- How to Donate

Description and How to Donate are both formatted
in Markdown to stylize the content.

Any time a change is made, it will be submitted to
the community for verification. This is to avoid
trolls and gaining poor reputation (e.g. platforms
removing certain content so that their logos don't
seem like they're supporting controversy). This
is basically StackOverflow or Quora style of suggested
edits.

The community's voting system: any time a vote
is needed, there is a mandatory timer that is set
to collect all votes. Here are the voting rules.
To pass a(n):

- Edit to organization descriptions: 70% majority, 7 day period
- Permit an organization to be added: 80% majority, 14 day period

Admins/staff of this platform have the power to overrule any of these
votes in any circumstance. Adding organizations still require staff.

Contribution Point system:

Users on the platform contributing will earn points.

- Voting counts as 1 point.
- Editing is 10 points and varies based on how large the edit is.
- Adding an organization to the platform gains 5 points.
- Submitting (ambiguously valid but satisfactory) proof of the organization gains an additional 45 points (one time and must be accepted).

Verified Account Managers
-------------------------

Verified account managers can make direct changes to the organization
in the database, including name, description, and how-to-donate.
Any restrictions on the standard format is released, allowing for
freely writing anything you want.

The community is also allowed to continue editing your organization.
(They will still follow the same aforementioned rules of voting, though).

Some organizations would like to take full control, making sure
the community cannot randomly edit something. Taking full control
will deny community members from voluntarily maintaining your
organization, which may be detrimental. The power of open-source
is terribly underestimated in that there are many good-natured
people looking to take care of your organization.

Taking full control or staying in the hybrid format is up to the
verified account, and the option can be switched whenever.

There can only be one verified account manager per organization.
No exception as social engineering attacks are at their highest.

To apply to become a verified account, you must submit a form
verifying yourself and your organization as real. If you have
a social media account, posting with #DonateAnything on Twitter
or mentioning on any social media platform can speed up verification
as we want to make sure the manager account is valid via as much
proof as possible.
