   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Donate Anything's documentation!
======================================================================

A website that shows charities by filtering on the items you want to donate,
maintained completely open-source and moderated voluntarily. Our website
is located at: `donate-anything.org`_

.. _donate-anything.org: https://donate-anything.org/

If you're confused on how this website works, see :ref:`how-to`.

If you'd like to contribute to our code base, whether or not
you even know how to code, visit our `repository`_. If you don't
know how to code, it's fine! Open a GitHub issue and let us
know your ideas! Donate Anything has a generic goal with lots
of ideas that we'd like to expand upon.
