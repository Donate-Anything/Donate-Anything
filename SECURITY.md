# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have found a vulnerability, do not open a GitHub issue.
Directly email Donate Anything at donatinganything@gmail.com.
If you are unable to reach Donate Anything through that email,
directly email Andrew Chen Wang at acwangpython@gmail.com.

Do not open a CVE until the issue has been resolved. If the
vulnerability is more wide spread and affects more applications
that just Donate Anything, please file a CVE and open a GitHub
issue at your discretion.

## Finding a solution

Instead of opening a GitHub issue in wake of a vulnerability,
immediately open a GitHub pull request and ping @Andrew-Chen-Wang
or @Donate-Anything. This way, core maintainers can quickly verify
the vulnerability and resolve the issue.
